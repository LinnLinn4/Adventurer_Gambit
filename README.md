# Adventurer_Gambit
 Adventurer's Gambit is a 2D board game-inspired adventure with a top-down perspective, where players engage in turn-based combat and events by spinning a wheel. Players navigate the board, encountering various obstacles like goblins, golems, and demon generals, aiming to defeat the final boss. The wheelâ€™s outcome is influenced by player and enemy stats, introducing strategic elements. Along the way, players can interact with shops, traps, and special events like the Wheel of Fortune. If defeated, players return to the start, but victory demands conquering all generals before the ultimate boss battle.
